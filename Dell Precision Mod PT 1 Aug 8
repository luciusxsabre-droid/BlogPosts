Rebuilding a Dell precision T5600 part 1

So I want to start at the beginning. 
So I started with the teardown this involved doing the steps as followed.

- Remove the mainboard - there was lots of screws and to even get access to them, well some of them
even the cpu heatsinks had to be removed. So what started of all this.

HOW IT STARTED

Well my dell precision posted but always continued to hit a 1 2 3 lit up. Via the troubleshooting lights at the front of the unit. 
I think the system would boot but not into a OS which is what sparked this project to begin with, now that you have the context.
Back to the tear down.

THE BREAKOUT BOARD

- so now that the mainboard is out it is time to remove all other components. such as fan cages unecessary wires. etc
then it was time to remove the breakout board which I could not remove via unscrewing so I had to crack this open
with a flathead which allowed me to pop out the breakout board.

the cables were all disconnected from the breakout upon removal. 

Now where from here ...

After test fitting components I am in a prime postion to rebuild the unit.

ENTER THE X99 COMPONENTS 

Now it is time to drop X99 Components into this build but before this we need to mod and prep the case.

I have bought some electrical tape to cover the metal area where the mainboard will be screwed into
I am doing this to cover off the standoffs that do not align with the standard mounting holes.
so doing this will stop any potential shorting out in theory and yes this will be done in layers.

Now I will wait for these components to arrive and then part 2 will posted.

but wait call now, there is more . . . 

Using avation snips I am going to remove the PSU Cage. Then carefully tape the edges to stop potential cuts.

PARTS USED FOR THIS UPGRADE / SLEEPER BUILD
- FSP VITA 850W
- X99 MOTHERBOARD DUAL SOCKET WITH E5 2680 V4
