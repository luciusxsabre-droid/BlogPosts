Hello and welcome to my new Plaintext Blog.

I have just made this repo as of tonight. I will be doing more detailed posts 
coming, very soon. Along posting art in my art repository.

Now I know this is a very unorthodox use for github but it is better than nothing I suppose.

I have a lot I want to share with this community and the community I am aiming to build going forward.
I may not be a programmer but I hope you enjoy the art and me sharing my thoughts.

Anyway, I will return I guess.

Until next time 
thank you and bye :)
